### About us

<!-- <img class='img-responsive center-block' src="/images/logo/swarm-lab-logo.png" width="100%" height="100%" /> -->

We are a group of scientists and engineers working at the intersection between robotics, control theory, machine learning, and game theory to design high performance, interactive autonomous systems. Our lab is based in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu) [Wireless Networking and Communications Group (WNCG)](https://wncg.org/) and [Texas Robotics](https://robotics.utexas.edu) at UT Austin.

### Research
Some of our lab's core research interests are:

#### - **Blockchain Applications in Machine Learning and Federated Learning, Control Methods for Token economies**:


#### - **Decentralized data sharing algorithms for multi-agent systems**:
Federated learning (FL) has been widely used in multi-agent systems with homogeneous neural models. However, FL is not suitable when agents have heterogeneous models whose gradients of weights cannot be shared. We proposed a decentralized data sharing algorithm for agents with heterogeneous models. In our algorithm, agents share data with each other and collaboratively achieve any data distribution by playing a potential game. Also, when the number of agents is large, we proposed a decentralized algorithm to select a subset of agents to play the potential game. We show that our algorithms are provably convergent and achieve the same performance as the centralized algorithm with linear time complexity execution.

#### - **Realistic adversarial data augmentation for robust models**: 
Current data augmentation methods use data cropping and rotation techniques on **pixel domain**. However, we argue that these methods do not capture the real world adversarial examples. We propose new data augmentation methods for time series in model predictive controllers and images in vision-based robotic controllers. We use gradient ascent to generate realistic adversarial examples. We show that our method is more effective than the current state-of-the-art data augmentation methods in terms of **robustness** and **performance** on unseen datasets.
